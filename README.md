# Build-an-Analytical-Platform-for-eCommerce-using-AWS-Services
 Ecommerce analytics spans the whole customer journey, from discovery through acquisition, conversion, and eventually retention and support.We can then utilize this information to deduce changes in customer behavior and online shopping patterns.
Create two analytical pipelines, Batch and Real-time. The Batch processing will involve data ingestion, Lake House architecture, processing, visualization using AWS kinesis, AWS Glue,Amazon S3 , and QuickSight to draw insights.
The Real-time channel involves detecting Distributed denial of service (DDoS) and Bot attacks using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, and AWS SNS
